# Build a Calculator

This exercise will help you understand how to use JavaScript functions as well as to start interacting with the DOM.

## Step 1: Set up your project

- Create an `index.html` file
- Create a `main.css` file and link it to your `index.html` file
- Create a `main.js` file and link it to your `index.html` file

## Step 2: Build the HTML

- Using the mockup provided below, create your HTML

## Step 3: Apply the Styles

- Using the mockup provided below, create and apply the correct CSS Styles

## Step 4: Write the JavaScript

- This is the main part of the project
    * Start small by selecting some elements
    * Create some functions to store repeatable steps

- You'll need to find a way to track the numbers pressed until the `=` is pressed
    * No need for chaining long calculations yet (see hard mode)

## Step 5: Submit Completed Assignment

- This project should be on your Github Account
- Please submit the project with a URL to your Github project

# Mockup

# Hard Mode

You should find the above project fairly challenging, however here are extra features you should attempt to add in.

- Chain complex calculations.
    * Ex: `5 + 5 - 4 / 10`
    * Take into account order of operation
    * You'll need a way to manage state if you do this

- Add a button to calculate the Modulo of 2 numbers
- Add a button to calculate the Square Root of 2 numbers
- Add a decimal button
